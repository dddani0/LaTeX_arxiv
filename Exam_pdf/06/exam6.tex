Let's start with an equation:
\begin{equation}
    \Bar{\psi _n} (P) = \frac{1}{2i} \sqrt{\frac{a}{\pi \hbar}} e^{i(\frac{n \pi}{2} - \frac{pa}{2 \hbar})} \bigg[ F \bigg(p - \frac{n \pi \hbar}{a}\bigg) + (-1)^{n+1} F \bigg(p + \frac{n \pi \hbar}{a}\bigg) \bigg]
\end{equation}
\par
This document focuses on figures. Actual drawing of figures (pictures) in \LaTeX ~is a bit complicated to be a task on this exam but we always need to insert external figures into our documents.\par
In Fig. 1 the schematic figure of a Fresnel lens is shown. The figure itself is stored in the file \verb|Fresnel-lens.eps.| It is adjusted symmetrically to the center of the page, its width is set to half the width of the page, and the colour of the caption is changed to red. \par
If there are any figures in the document it is possible to create a collection of the figure captions:
