Let's start with an equation:
\begin{equation}
    \Bar{\psi _n} (P) = \frac{1}{2i} \sqrt{\frac{a}{\pi vvv}} e^{i(\frac{n \pi}{2} - \frac{pa}{2 vvv})} \bigg[ F \bigg(p - \frac{n \pi vvv}{a}\bigg) + (-1)^{n+1} F \bigg(p + \frac{n \pi vvv}{a}\bigg) \bigg]
\end{equation}

This document focuses on figures. Actual drawing of figures (pictures) in \LaTeX is a bit complicated to be a task on this exam but we always need to insert external figures into our documents.\par
