\begin{abstract}
We propose a circuit-level model combining the Marcus-Hush-Chidsey electron current equation and the Yakopcic equation for the state variable for describing resistive switching memory devices of the structure metal–ionic conductor–metal. We extend the dynamics of the state variable originally described by a first-order time derivative by introducing a fractional derivative with an arbitrary order between zero and one. We show that the extended model fits with great fidelity the current-voltage characteristic data obtained on a Si electrochemical metallization memory device with Ag-Cu alloy\\
